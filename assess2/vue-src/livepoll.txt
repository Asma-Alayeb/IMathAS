LivePoll approach:

For Teachers:
startassess returns livepoll status
  ? Also returns existing results data, in case of a page reset or something
Top nav is question selection, with "settings" in place of "Intro"
In top nav is "start" and "stop" controls
If status is 'not started'
  Show question for teacher if 'show on this computer before started' is selected
When 'start' is clicked
  update imas_livepoll_status
  Send msg to livepoll server
  Start timer
  If 'show results live' is enabled
    Show results as they come in
When 'stop' is clicked
  update imas_livepoll_status
  Send msg to livepoll server
  if 'show results' is enabled
    show results

For Students:
startassess returns livepoll status.
If status is 'not started',
  then show a 'Waiting for teacher to start a question' notice
If status is 'active question'
  then run loadquestion to show the question
  On submission,
    Give acknowledgement of submission
    Reshow question to allow resubmitting
If status is 'stopped'
  reshow question w answer, disabled
If status is 'show scored'
  reshow question, scored
