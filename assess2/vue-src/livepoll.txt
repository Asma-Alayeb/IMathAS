LivePoll approach:

states:
0 - nothing displayed
1 - question loaded on instructor side
2 - question open for students
3 - closed and reshow q without score
4 - closed and reshow q with score

In Launch view
  - x Inject socket javascript if livepoll type

In loadsettings, override some settings for livepoll:
 - x always do by_question
 - x always do "all students same seed"  |4
 - disable question shuffle if enabled
 - Need to make sure teacher also gets same seed as students

In startassess
  - x Return livepoll status (create if needed)

x Move livepoll settings into a component
  - x Use getters/setters to store the default settings into main store

In front-end
  - x On mount, connect to socket server
  - Teachers:
    - x Top nav is question selection, with "settings" in place of "Intro"
    - x Start and Stop controls
    - x Number of students connected
    - x Results display below question
  - Students:
    - x Only display is question.
    - When question

On teacher question selection
  - x replace current settings w defaults
  - x call setLivepollStatus to call server
    - x endpoint updates livepolll status
    - ???
      - endpoint calls livepoll server with status update
      - livepoll emits message to change state
      - on reply, set curquestion so question updates
    - get HTML with state update
      - Or, call loadquestion (show or hide based on "Show question" setting)

On teacher "Open Student Input"
  - call livepoll endpoint
  - endpoint updates livepoll status
  - endpoint calls livepoll server with status update
  - livepoll emits message to students to start input

Student: on status update to start input
  - Call loadquestion
  - Loadquestion verifies status
  - Loadquestion verifies seed, and creates a new question version if needed
  - loadquestion returns actual question for input

Student: on submission
  - Calls scorequestion
  - Scorequestion just returns acknowledgement of receipt; show recorded note
    and allow resubmission

On teacher "Close Student Input"
  - call livepoll endpoint
  - endpoint updates livepoll status
  - endpoint calls livepoll server with status update
  - livepoll emits message to students to start input

Student: on status update to end input
  - call loadquestion again to view scored version
  - if "show answers" is set (curstate=4) then show answers w question

If instructor changes the "show answers" option
  - calls livepoll endpoint, does status update, etc.
  - Student side calls loadquestion again to get new HTML w/wo answers


For Teachers:
x startassess returns livepoll status
  ? Also returns existing results data, in case of a page reset or something
Top nav is question selection, with "settings" in place of "Intro"
In top nav is "start" and "stop" controls
If status is 'not started'
  Show question for teacher if 'show on this computer before started' is selected
When 'start' is clicked
  update imas_livepoll_status
  Send msg to livepoll server
  Start timer
  If 'show results live' is enabled
    Show results as they come in
When 'stop' is clicked
  update imas_livepoll_status
  Send msg to livepoll server
  if 'show results' is enabled
    show results

For Students:
x startassess returns livepoll status.
for all stu same ver
If status is 'not started',
  then show a 'Waiting for teacher to start a question' notice
If status is 'active question'
  then run loadquestion to show the question
    Need loadquestion to check livepoll status to verify
    If instructor has regen'd, then need to create a new question version w that seed
  On submission,
    Give acknowledgement of submission
    Reshow question to allow resubmitting
If status is 'stopped'
  reshow question w answer, disabled
If status is 'show scored'
  reshow question, scored


API endpoint for livepoll
  Handles all the startq / stopq / etc messaging
Existing scorequestion can handle scoring - add code for sending result socket msg
