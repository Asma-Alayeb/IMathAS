Make sure rescoreassess method also updates iar.timeontask total

Newver /course/gb-itemanalysis.php
  - For by-assessment, should we could all attempts? or just scored?
  - For by-question, should we just count scored version for timespent, or all versions?
  - Do we estimate per-try times, or just leave them out?
Newver /course/gb-itemanalysisdetail.php
Newver /course/gb-itemresults.php
  - Might be a little easier now, if we're storing unrand selection
  - Probably can't do this one until displayq refactor is integrated
Newver /course/gb-aidexport.php
  - Ditto on above
Newver /course/gb-rescoreq.php
  - Should be simpler, since we have stored stuans for most question types and
    can replicate clientside eval
Newver /course/gb-viewasid.php
  - Might be some summary components we could reuse, maybe some widgets
  - Not essential to use Vue, but would be nice for walking through previous tries/versions
    - When walking through retakes, would want all the summary info to update too
Newver /course/gradeallq.php
  - Should this only show scored version?
Newver /course/modquestion.php  (need to update query to look for i_q w no i_a_s or i_a_r)

  - What if they're out of regens?

    - If so, how do we communicate that, especially in massexception where diff
      assessments might have diff types
