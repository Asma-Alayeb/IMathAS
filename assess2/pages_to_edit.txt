To discuss:
  What options do we want to allow overrides for at the per-question level?
    How will we enforce the values are reasonable if assess settings change?
    Could limit showans options to:
      Use default
      Never during
      after last attempt / after take (depending on showscores setting)
    Then auto-remap after_lastattempt <-> after_take if showscores is changed later
    ** OR, just limit to use default / Never.
  How will "force regens" work on exceptions page?
    Shorten language to "Force student to work on new versions?" w explaination
    Remove the "clear student's atempts" option at massexception level
  Exception: timelimit check (latepass isn't useful)
    need to check if retakes remain & if not, whether latest attempt timelimit is expired
    Maybe store latepass_useless time (def 2000000000) at i_a_r level?
    Won't auto-update if assess setting is changed.
  Do we really want the ability to view in GB without seeing scores in GB?
    Nice for "ability to review work", but what will it look like? (can use N/A like NoScores does now)
  For skip-around by-assessment, should 'score' only reflect submitted assessment takes?
    Or should it depend on showscores setting?
  Gradeallq: only show questions from scored take / scored version
  Test: Multipart questions with one part
  Based on viewingb setting, make previous attempts list on launch/closed have links
    with confirm warnings that it will block latepass use. But then would need
    link to be able to bring up specific aver... 
  ACK: need to rethink gradebook blocking latepass use, and differentiate b/t
    views of submitted attempts and viewing active/unsubmitted attempt.

TODOs:
  X GET novideo icon displaying right in addquestions
  X Figure out extref display on questions
  ! Need to revisit showhints throughout display code
  X Print Version: Remove blue box, make Print version primary
    X Disable input boxes if possible
    X Fix styling (no curved borders)
    Make sure MQ is disabled too, or just turn off on Print page
  Look into recclick tracking for question helps and assessment visits
  Test accounting Qs
  Implement keepscore options: best, last, average
  Make sure assess scoreoverride is considered in reTotalAssess
  Takeanythingorblank??
    pass jsparam to front end.  Include in submission anything on first try
    with "submitblank" param set.
  Prop types
  tinymce drag handle showing when question is not active
  store timeontask for whole assessment attempt when in full-test-view
  Get overtime handled
  Add an "out of retakes" status 32 to use in warning LP won't help
  Future TODO: migrate itemorder to JSON format

Newver /course/gb-itemanalysis.php
  - For by-assessment, should we could all attempts? or just scored?
  - For by-question, should we just count scored version for timespent, or all versions?
  - Do we estimate per-try times, or just leave them out?
Newver /course/gb-itemanalysisdetail.php
Newver /course/gb-itemresults.php
  - Might be a little easier now, if we're storing unrand selection
  - Probably can't do this one until displayq refactor is integrated
Newver /course/gb-aidexport.php
  - Ditto on above
Newver /course/gb-rescoreq.php
  - Should be simpler, since we have stored stuans for most question types and
    can replicate clientside eval
Newver /course/gb-viewasid.php
  - Might be some summary components we could reuse, maybe some widgets
  - Not essential to use Vue, but would be nice for walking through previous tries/versions
    - When walking through retakes, would want all the summary info to update too
Newver /course/gradeallq.php
  - Should this only show scored version?
  - This one probably not in Vue (no need)
Newver /course/chgassessments.php

// LOOK for pages calling calcandupdateLTIgrade
// If we're going to introduce a JSON itemorder format, need to modify everything that touches itemorder too (!)

  - What if they're out of regens?
  - For by-assessment, do we force new take?
    - If so, how do we communicate that, especially in massexception where diff
      assessments might have diff types
~ Edit /course/massexception.php (need to handle or rewrite "force regen")
  Punt on these by just disabling the regen option for now.
~ Edit /forums/posthandler.php
  Punt by continuing to use displayq2 for now
