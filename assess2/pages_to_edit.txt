To discuss:
  What options do we want to allow overrides for at the per-question level?
    How will we enforce the values are reasonable if assess settings change?
    Could limit showans options to:
      Use default
      Never during
      after last attempt / after take (depending on showscores setting)
    Then auto-remap after_lastattempt <-> after_take if showscores is changed later
    ** OR, just limit to use default / Never.
  How will "force regens" work on exceptions page?
  Exception: timelimit check (latepass isn't useful)
  Do we really want the ability to view in GB without seeing scores in GB?
    Nice for "ability to review work", but what will it look like? (can use N/A like NoScores does now)
  For skip-around by-assessment, should 'score' only reflect submitted assessment takes?
    Or should it depend on showscores setting?
  Gradeallq: only show questions from scored take / scored version


TODOs:
  X GET novideo icon displaying right in addquestions
  Figure out extref display on questions
    Need to revisit showhints throughout display code
  X Print Version: Remove blue box, make Print version primary
    X Disable input boxes if possible
    Fix styling (no curved borders)
    Make sure MQ is disabled too, or just turn off on Print page

Test accounting

Newver /course/gb-itemanalysis.php
  - For by-assessment, should we could all attempts? or just scored?
  - For by-question, should we just count scored version for timespent, or all versions?
  - Do we estimate per-try times, or just leave them out?
Newver /course/gb-itemanalysisdetail.php
Newver /course/gb-itemresults.php
  - Might be a little easier now, if we're storing unrand selection
  - Probably can't do this one until displayq refactor is integrated
Newver /course/gb-aidexport.php
  - Ditto on above
Newver /course/gb-rescoreq.php
  - Should be simpler, since we have stored stuans for most question types and
    can replicate clientside eval
Newver /course/gb-viewasid.php
  - Might be some summary components we could reuse, maybe some widgets
  - Not essential to use Vue, but would be nice for walking through previous tries/versions
    - When walking through retakes, would want all the summary info to update too
Newver /course/gradeallq.php
  - Should this only show scored version?
  - This one probably not in Vue (no need)
~ Newver /course/modquestion.php  (need to update query to look for i_q w no i_a_s or i_a_r)
  - Tries allowed for this problem
  - Penalty: __% after ___ full-credit tries
  - When by-question:
    - Versions allowed
    - Penalties for new versions
  - Show answers
  - show hints
  - show video/text help buttons
  - Rubric
  - Fixed seeds
~ Newver /course/modquestiongrid.php
  - Already added:
    - Tries allowed
    - Show hints / help
    - Copies to add
  - Initial add
    - Points
    - Stuff above
    - Add as group
    - Set points = number of parts
