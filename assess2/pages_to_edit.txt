TODOs:
  Make sure MQ is disabled on Print page, or just turn off
  Test accounting Qs
  Prop types
  ? tinymce drag handle showing when question is not active
  Get overtime handled
  Add "latepass won't help you" warning on Closed page
  ! Need to revisit showhints throughout display code
  FIX: don't give "answers haven't changed" warning on assessment submit
  Make sure course page indicators are working
  Teacher view-as-student working

Newver /course/gb-itemanalysis.php
  - For by-assessment, should we could all attempts? or just scored?
  - For by-question, should we just count scored version for timespent, or all versions?
  - Do we estimate per-try times, or just leave them out?
Newver /course/gb-itemanalysisdetail.php
Newver /course/gb-itemresults.php
  - Might be a little easier now, if we're storing unrand selection
  - Probably can't do this one until displayq refactor is integrated
Newver /course/gb-aidexport.php
  - Ditto on above
Newver /course/gb-rescoreq.php
  - Should be simpler, since we have stored stuans for most question types and
    can replicate clientside eval
Newver /course/gb-viewasid.php
  - Might be some summary components we could reuse, maybe some widgets
  - Not essential to use Vue, but would be nice for walking through previous tries/versions
    - When walking through retakes, would want all the summary info to update too
Newver /course/gradeallq.php
  - Should this only show scored version?
  - This one probably not in Vue (no need)
Newver /course/chgassessments.php
  Separate General Options from Assessment Options
  Have No change option in dropdowns, switch radio/checks to dropdowns.
    So "change" box isn't required
  Have core options set so if one is changed, a notice is displayed that all
    need to be changed (mark option with *)
  In "Copy options" page, when selected, show a link to review the settings in a new window
  Maybe add tabs: one for assessments and one for settings
  Maybe have block groups collapseable?
  Icons on assessments in selector?


~ Newver /course/modquestion.php
~ Newver /course/modquestiongrid.php
    Need to adjust options on these
    Limit showans to use default / Never.
~ Edit /course/outcometable.php (need to fix viewingb/scoresingb handling)
~ Edit /course/gbtable2.php (need to fix viewingb/scoresingb handling, get includecomments working)
~ Edit /includes/exceptionfuncs.php (Need to figure a way to determine if out of retakes)
~ Edit /course/exception.php  (need to handle or rewrite "force regen" option)
  - What if they're out of regens?
  - For by-assessment, do we force new take?
    - If so, how do we communicate that, especially in massexception where diff
      assessments might have diff types
~ Edit /course/massexception.php (need to handle or rewrite "force regen")
  Punt on these by just disabling the regen option for now.
~ Edit /forums/posthandler.php
  Punt by continuing to use displayq2 for now

Future Todos:
  Build modal for redeeming latepasses for LTI users.
  Figure better way to handle change of user prefs.
  migrate itemorder to JSON format

Delay for later (since they work with displayq2 for now):
  Edit/Rewrite testquestion.php
  Edit/Rewrite embedq.php

X GET novideo icon displaying right in addquestions
X Figure out extref display on questions
X Print Version: Remove blue box, make Print version primary
  X Disable input boxes if possible
  X Fix styling (no curved borders)
x Exception: timelimit check (latepass isn't useful)
  need to check if retakes remain & if not, whether latest attempt timelimit is expired
  Maybe store latepass_useless time (def 2000000000) at i_a_r level?
  Won't auto-update if assess setting is changed.
X Look into recclick tracking for question helps and assessment visits
X Implement keepscore options: best, last, average
X Make sure assess scoreoverride is considered in reTotalAssess
X Takeanythingorblank??
  pass jsparam to front end.  Include in submission anything on first try
  with "submitblank" param set.
X store timeontask for whole assessment attempt when in full-test-view
  use min of submitted lastloaded values to compute total time on screen
