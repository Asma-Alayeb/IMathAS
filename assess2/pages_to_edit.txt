TODOs:
  ~ Get overtime handled
    overtime penalty?  Still mark as overtime, but count in grade
    Make sure questions submitted after time limit are marked in gbviewassess
    Some display of when tries were submitted, maybe in previous tries display?
    normalize to overtime_grace and overtime_penalty
  ~ Perhaps GB detail display that shows part, date submitted (scored), and penalties applied
    Will need to add submission date to parts output object
  Need to revisit showhints throughout display code
  Teacher view-as-student working
  Test accounting Qs
  Click on '-' in GB to create new record for student (?)
  Build process for js/css
  Set timelimitexp in by_question and use it for making practice mode available,
    and for making grades avail in gradebook using after take setting

To discuss:
  Syntax error warnings: error icon w hoverover vs displaying error

Separate:
  Collate CSS
  Add a11y landmarks / skip navigation
  Build migration function
  Bundle support JS/css on build
  Improve build documentation


Minor TODOs:
  Add "latepass won't help you" warning on Closed page
  Prop types
  Make sure MQ is disabled on Print page, or just turn off
  tinymce drag handle showing when question is not active (doesn't honor visibility: hidden on parent)
  Handle "right answer wrong format"
  Matrix syntax warning messages

Newver /course/gb-itemanalysis.php
  - For by-assessment, should we could all attempts? or just scored?
  - For by-question, should we just count scored version for timespent, or all versions?
  - Do we estimate per-try times, or just leave them out?
Newver /course/gb-itemanalysisdetail.php
Newver /course/gb-itemresults.php
  - Might be a little easier now, if we're storing unrand selection
  - Probably can't do this one until displayq refactor is integrated
Newver /course/gb-aidexport.php
  - Ditto on above

Newver /course/gb-rescoreq.php
  - Should be simpler, since we have stored stuans for most question types and
    can replicate clientside eval



Future Todos:
  Build modal for redeeming latepasses for LTI users.
  Figure better way to handle change of user prefs.
  migrate itemorder to JSON format

Delay for later (since they work with displayq2 for now):
  Edit/Rewrite testquestion.php
  Edit /forums/posthandler.php
  Edit/Rewrite embedq.php
  Edit/Rewrite multiembedq.php
Delay for later:
  Edit/Rewrite /util/crosscoursedata.php
  Edit/Rewrite /util/crosscoursedatadetail.php
  ~ Edit /course/exception.php  (need to handle or rewrite "force regen" option)
    - What if they're out of regens?
    - For by-assessment, do we force new take?
      - If so, how do we communicate that, especially in massexception where diff
        assessments might have diff types
  ~ Edit /course/massexception.php (need to handle or rewrite "force regen")
    Punt on these by just disabling the regen option for now.

X GET novideo icon displaying right in addquestions
X Figure out extref display on questions
X Print Version: Remove blue box, make Print version primary
  X Disable input boxes if possible
  X Fix styling (no curved borders)
x Exception: timelimit check (latepass isn't useful)
  need to check if retakes remain & if not, whether latest attempt timelimit is expired
  Maybe store latepass_useless time (def 2000000000) at i_a_r level?
  Won't auto-update if assess setting is changed.
X Look into recclick tracking for question helps and assessment visits
X Implement keepscore options: best, last, average
X Make sure assess scoreoverride is considered in reTotalAssess
X Takeanythingorblank??
  pass jsparam to front end.  Include in submission anything on first try
  with "submitblank" param set.
X store timeontask for whole assessment attempt when in full-test-view
  use min of submitted lastloaded values to compute total time on screen
